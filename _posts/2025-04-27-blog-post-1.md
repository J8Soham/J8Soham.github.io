Notes of typing 
======

### **Patterns in your typing mistakes:**

1. **Adjacent Key Errors**
    
    - Miss-clicks like `e` instead of `w`, `s` instead of `m`, `d` instead of `r`, `n` instead of `m`, etc., suggest **finger positioning issues** — you're just slightly off the intended key.
    
2. **Left/Right Hand Confusions**
    
    - Mistakes like `e` for `b`, `h` for `b`, `n` for `b`, `k` for `d` — a lot of these involve **switching hands or reaching awkwardly** across the keyboard.
    
3. **Skipping Letters or Words**
    
    - You mentioned hitting letters after missing one (`missed o but pressed the rest of the word`) — this shows your brain might be **getting ahead of your fingers**. You're trying to "type fast" instead of "type accurately."    
    
4. **Capitalization Errors**
    
    - Random capitals like "THere" suggest maybe **holding shift too long** or **not coordinating shift key release**.
    
5. **Pressing Numbers by Accident**
    
    - Especially at the start — this could be due to **wrong hand positioning** at the very beginning (your fingers might not be resting on the correct "home row" keys).

### **Suggestions for Improvement:**

- **Prioritize Accuracy Over Speed**  
    Focus on slowing down a little to hit the correct keys **first**. Speed will come naturally after your muscle memory gets stronger.
    
- **Home Row Drills**  
    Spend a few minutes at the start of practice just **typing “asdf jkl;”** over and over without looking down. This will strengthen your "default" hand position.
    
- **Use Online Typing Tools with Error Heatmaps**  
    Sites like Keybr.com or 10fastfingers can show you **which specific letters** you miss the most.
    
- **Micro Pauses After Mistakes**  
    If you mess up, **pause briefly**. Let yourself reset mentally, then continue. Try not to "rush through" mistakes — it trains bad habits.
    
- **Finger Strength and Stretch Exercises**  
    Some of your missclicks might be from **weak pinkies or ring fingers** (they're notoriously weak for typing). Try simple exercises like pressing down each key with only your pinky 10x.
    
- **Start Each Practice With a Quick Position Check**  
    Before you start, **wiggle your fingers** over the home row keys so you’re 100% sure you're starting in the right place.
