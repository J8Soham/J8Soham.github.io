My complicated relationship with sincerity
======

So I have a very complicated relationship with sincerity. I feel in my life there are many times I have been sincere that I truly like myself during those times and sometimes where I didn't. A lot of my regrets can be tied to me not being sincere with others and a lot of the times I have been hurt by others is when they weren't sincere with me.

So I was writing down my values just like I have done many times but this one sincerity has given me the most emotional disturbance kinda like a wave going through my heart and I am unsure. I feel this value explains a lot of what I feel in a day to day basis. 

Lack of Sincerity
======
I feel like sometimes I make promises so easily with a very important lack of ablity to know what's being asked of me and the amount of work that I would have to accomplish which I don't like.

Lol that got a lot of the things I was feeling but didn't have the confidence to voice out. I should keep a list of all the promises I have made and fulfill them as of now.
