1. Set site-wide configuration and add your content.
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the `files/` directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.

TODO (Build on this):
- Data garden as inspired from https://jzhao.xyz 
- Heatmaps for tracking habits - maybe;??? 
- Links as inspired by NEOCITIES & Ted Nelson (Change of Blog Format) 
- Possibly Games and Visualizations
- Nice reads (Research Papers + Books) 
- Map with all the cool places around.
- Settings for sigining in? Maybe not 

Reasoning in doing and not doing things is the question of do they fit the theme
