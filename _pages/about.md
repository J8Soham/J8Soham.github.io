  Independently creating an embeddable chatbot with Vue.js and FastAPI, and developing an AI RAG model.

- **Baskin Engineering Tutor** at UC Santa Cruz (September 2024 - Present)
  Serving as a teaching and grading assistant for CSE 107 (Probability and Statistics for Engineers) and mentoring students in Computer Systems, Assembly Language, and Data Structures.

## Projects & Technical Skills

I've developed several notable projects including:
- **Banana Emulator**: A console emulator with GPU renderer implementation
- **Multithreaded HTTP Server**: A functional server using thread pools and task queues
- **Blue Jay**: An embeddable chatbot for WordPress
